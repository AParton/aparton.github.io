In order to better understand disease mechanisms, we use a direct approach and develop literature-based high-quality both machine- and human-readable comprehensive representations of disease mechanisms â€“ disease maps.

The Disease Maps Project is an expert-approved pathway-based reconstruction customised for a particular disease, a graphical review on the molecular mechanisms of a disease. It is a collection of interconnected signalling, metabolic and gene regulatory pathways stored in standard formats (SBGN, SBML, BioPAX). The involvement of domain experts ensures that all the important disease landmarks are covered and relevant knowledge is adequately represented.

The approach allows customized and precise network enrichment analysis which is complementary to various generic solutions such as freely available g:Profiler and DAVID (not longer updated), or commercial tool such as MetaCore and the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.

The maps are to be used for -omics data interpretation and identification of disease subtypes, biomarkers, corresponding molecular mechanisms and drug targets; as well as the basis for mathematical modelling and <i>in silico</i> experiments.

RAMap is a disease map of rheumatoid arthritis. The map is currently being improved and expanded as our knowledge develops.
